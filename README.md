# kinetic-components

Kinetic components helps you animate a single React component and orchestrate animations amongst a collection of React components.

Use CSS animations or any JS animation library you like!

# Examples

All examples can be found in the playground at [https://erhathaway.github.io/kinetic-components/](https://erhathaway.github.io/kinetic-components/).

# TL;DR

Usage is describe in the playground ^

In short, the library works by having an `Animate` and `Animatable` component. The `Animate` component controls the `Animatable` component. You can style the `Animatable` component and nest children under it (like additional Animate - Animatable nestings). When you change the `Animates` `visible` prop, predicate functions in the `when` prop are evaluated and associated animation functions are run on the nested `Animatable` component's DOM element.

You can control how multiple `Animate - Animatable` pairings animate together using `animationBindings`. These allow you to do things like wait on children before leaving or wait on parents before entering.

Futhermore, you can do more than just animate enter and exit states. Using the custom `triggerState` prop you can provide additional predicate based animations that run on all sorts of state changes!

| when                   | x        | `Array<[Predicates or Predicate, PredicateAnimation, Options]>` | The logic that has predicate - animationFn pairings. Options is an object of type `{key: string}`. The `key` is used to track if the same animation is applied twice in a row. Normally, animation libs and CSS animations would have a noop action b/c the transform is already applied. Kinetic handles this by doing a component unmount to clear the transforms then it runs the animation. If you want to avoid the unmount, don't pass in the optional `key` |  |
